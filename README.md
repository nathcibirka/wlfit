# Weak lensing analysis

This repo performs a weak lensing analysis over a given sample of galaxy clusters, based on the shear measurements and photometric information.

The model is composed by the main halo term, described by a NFW profile, the 2-halo term and the off-centring term.

The analysis can be performed over a stacked sample or individually.
