# Weak lensing analysis

This repo performs weak lensing analysis over a sample of galaxy clusters, based on the shear measurements and photometric information. The constrained parameters are the mass and concnetration. 

The model is composed by the main halo term, described by a NFW profile, the 2-halo term and the off-centring term.

The analysis can be performed over a stacked sample or individually.
